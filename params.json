{"name":"Breakpoint","body":"Breakpoint is a mobile first fluid layout that can be triggered \r\nat a break point to go fixed. Styles cascade from smaller break \r\npoints up into larger ones. The breakpoint mixin provides a simple method of\r\nsetting element sizes when certain break points become available. \r\nMedia queries for any number of columns are automatically generated\r\nwhen the screen becomes wide enough for their display.\r\nEverything is calculated from the column and gutter size width variables.\r\n\r\nSimply stated you just need to know how many columns you need for a \r\nlayout and breakpoint will generate the media query needed to trigger that layout.\r\n\r\n### Grid Setup\r\n\r\nYou can setup your project by defining a couple variables needed to configure\r\nyour grid.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$column:\t 60px;\t// column-width of your grid in pixels\r\n$gutter:\t 20px;\t// gutter-width of your grid in pixels\r\n$columns:\t 16;\t// maximum number of columns needed for layout\r\n$fixed-grid: 8;\t\t// number of columns to trigger fixed grid\r\n$ie-support: false; // number of columns for vintage ie\r\n$show-grid:  false; // shows a visual grid overlay\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetting `$column` `$gutter` and `$columns` define your grid. Breakpoint uses\r\nthese values to generate the size of elements and the media queries necessary\r\nto trigger those element sizes.\r\n\r\n`$fixed-grid` sets the number of columns necessary to transform the grid from a fluid to\r\na fixed layout.\r\n\r\n#### IE Support\r\n\r\n`$ie-support` set the number of columns that vintage IE should use as a layout. Since\r\nbreakpoint generates most of your structure inside media queries vintage IE won't see\r\nit and thus serve the single column fluid layout. `$ie-support` will make sure that a\r\nsingle, fixed grid layout gets served to vintage IE without media queries. You need to\r\nmake sure that the column count you set for `$ie-support` matches another layout in your\r\ncode.\r\n\r\n#### Grid Overlay\r\n\r\nSetting `$show-grid` to true will generate a visual overlay of your grid for testing.\r\n\r\n## The Breakpoint Mixin\r\n\r\n`breakpoint()` is the mixin you use to create layouts for a specific breakpoint. You pass\r\nthe number of columns you want on screen as an argument and breakpoint creates the media query\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@include breakpoint(8) {\r\n  .container  { width: col(8); }\r\n  .main       { width: col(5); }\r\n  .sidebar    { width: col(3); }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@include breakpoint(12) {\r\n  .container  { width: col(12); }\r\n  .main       { width: col(8); }\r\n  .sidebar    { width: col(4); }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code above generates the following markup...\r\n\r\n```\r\n@media (min-width: 41.25em) {\r\n  .container { width: 38.75em; }\r\n  .main      { width: 23.75em; }\r\n  .sidebar   { width: 13.75em; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media (min-width: 61.25em) {\r\n  .container { width: 58.75em; }\r\n  .main      { width: 38.75em; }\r\n  .sidebar   { width: 18.75em; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Sandboxing\r\n\r\nBreakpoint uses a mobile first approach to cascading styles up to larger layouts. Sometimes\r\nit might be necessary to sandbox some styles between two breakpoints to prevent them\r\nfrom cascading up to larger layouts. The `breakpoint()` mixin will accept a second\r\nargument for cases like this and generate a min/max width media query for those styles.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@include breakpoint(9, 11) {\r\n  .main { /* sandboxed styles */ }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill generate...\r\n\r\n```\r\n@media (min-width: 46.25em) and (max-width: 56.25em) {\r\n  .main { /* sandboxed styles */ }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Pro Tip**: If you set the min column to 0 when sandboxing then breakpoint will create\r\na max width media query. Use this if you need styles to cascade down instead of up.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nBreakpoint uses the following frameworks and technologies:\r\n\r\n[H5BP](http://html5boilerplate.com/), \r\n[normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/), \r\n[Frameless Grid](http://framelessgrid.com/), \r\n[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), \r\n[Compass](http://compass-style.org/)","tagline":"Breakpoint aims to take some of the pain out of creating a responsive layout.
